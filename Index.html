        <h3>Why ASDF Matters</h3>
        <p>The Responsibility to provide Quality Education rest upon Us All
            As a non profit organisation, we rely on support both financially and in kind to accomplish our aims: Hence we seek public support to complete some of our ongoing projects and accomplish some of our missions.
            It is our desire to implement some of our projects in some schools and fix some challenges like classroom roofs, fence, toilets etc. before the children return to the classroom.
            We welcome volunteers and sponsors alike in partnering to put smiles on the faces of our children.</p>
        <h3> Join and Change Lives Positively</h3>
        <p>Anayo Skills & Development Foundation is a volunteer driven organisation.
            Our volunteers are a team of experts zealous to donate their TIME, ENERGY AND MONEY (TEAM); these three make a unique classic personality.
            Some can only give time, others give energy while some, money; either way, we are all committed to giving all three to support a good cause </p>
